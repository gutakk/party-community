In this project I'd used tech stack as following
- React, Redux Thunk and SCSS for frontend
- Python (Flask, Psycopg) for backend
- PostgreSQL for database
- Docker for environment control

### Required tools to run this project
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### One-command to start app (need to install required tools first)
    docker-compose up -d
You will be able to access to web by using `localhost:3000` or with network ip on your mobile phone for example `192.168.1.114:3000`
